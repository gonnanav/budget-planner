- Use named exports only, no default exports
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types, unless a type definition is clearly needed
- Do no generate props that aren't actually used, including `className`, unless it's a highly reusable UI component
- Prefer direct imports, for example: `import { useState } from 'react'` over `import * as React from 'react'`.
- Don't add any comments explaining your code, unless it's truly warranted
- Don't export anything unless it's actually used elsewhere by at least one consumer.
