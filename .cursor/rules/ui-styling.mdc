- Mobile-first design
- UI should be minimal and clean looking
- Use HeroUI (formerly NextUI) components
- Use Lucide for icons
- Use Tailwind for styling with a theme-based approach - avoid hardcoding style values scattered throughout the codebase
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Use consistent spacing and sizing scales from the design system
